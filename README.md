Bundled Items is a Minecraft mod for version 1.7.10 -> 1.16.3 which adds a new bundled item for a bunch of existing
items. To craft the bundled items, place 9 of the items in the 3x3 crafting table, some recipes require a bowl
or a glass vial in the center. The max stack of bundled items is 32, so that means in one slot you could carry up to
288 items! This mod is aimed to help inventory management and to help with storage.

If you have the bundled item in your hotbar, you can shift right click it and it will unbundle, if the recipe
contained a bowl/vial this will also be given back.

### Downloads
