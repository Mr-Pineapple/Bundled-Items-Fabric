###

Bundled Items is a mod which allows you to bundle 9 items into one. This allows for some simple inventory management, by allowing you to carry more items in one slot. A bundled item will stack to a max of 32, allowing you to store up to, at most 288 items in one slot. Some items bundle together in eights, as they require a bowl or a glass vial, such as the apples, potatoes and snowballs.

### Recipes

Recipes for items in this mod are very similar. Most of the recipes just consist of nine of the items in a 3x3 crafting grid. However some contain bowls, and vials, recipes can be found below:
